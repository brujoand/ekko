He who yells into the forest will get a response.

Flow:
Goblin:
  1. We enter the forest as a goblin.
  2. The goblin yells for trolls
    a. A troll responds with it's broadcast id and we subscribe to it
    b. No trolls answer, and we grow into a Troll
  3. When our troll calls, we answer with our services
  4. If our troll stops calling go to 1.
Troll:
  1. We sit in our cave, waiting for goblins
  2. A goblin yells, and we respond with our broadcast id
  3. The goblin registers itself and we have it report it's services every now and then

Todo:
  - Add Wizards that can ask all the trolls about the world
  - Let trolls become goblins if they are not needed as trolls
